# Responsive Challenge: Dawg Coffee

Ying Dang

This folder contains your submission for the [responsive challenge](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/responsive). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What is the URL of this site, as hosted on your student webserver (i.e., students.washington.edu/<code>{uw-new-id}</code>/info343/<code>{project-name}</code>) #####
> http://students.washington.edu/whydang/info343/dawg-coffee/


##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> I received lots of help from the professor and Joanna. The help I've gotten outside of class relates to debugging why my site is not doing what I want it to. Antony helped a a bit, and so did Kyungmin when he asks the professor a question and thought it would be good to inform me of the clarifications he's received.

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> I did not complete the challenge. This site was a challenge as it stands already. I'm actually very happy with my results. Sure, the challenge would be great, but starting from no HTML skill to two weeks in and building a website is a great feat for me.

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> I took roughly about...30+ hours? I honestly didn't think it would take that long but boy was I wrong. Not only were there many things on the spec that were not as clear, but also there were things in this assignment we hardly touched based on. So it was really a matter of trial and error to really grab on to what works and what doesn't.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> The challenges I've faced are pretty much unclear specifications and getting lost in the middle of what I was doing. It would be nice to have some sort of table on the side to quickly jump around and see where I left off. Also, would be cool to implement some sort of checkbox so that students know what they've done and haven't. There were so many things to account for I found myself skipping the littlest details at times.
